Hitachi Store is the first web application I was involved in developling during the first summer vacation of my undergraduate study. This online store is developed with a group of four students. It is also the first time I have a understanding what is AJAX, MVC and modularizationã€‚

Technically, I practiced C#, CSS, HTML and had a good understanding of web development.

Hitachi Store includes following modules:
- Front stage modules:
  1. Evaluation
  2. GoodDisplay
  3. OrderExam
  4. SaleOrders
  5. UserRegister

- Back stage modules:
  1. Admin
  2. EvaluationAdmin
  3. GoodAdmin
  4. OrderAdmin
  5. UserAdmin
  6. SeniorAdmin
