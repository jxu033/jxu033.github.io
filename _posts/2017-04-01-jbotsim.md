#### Reference
[JBotSim](http://jbotsim.io/)

#### Project Introduction
It is a project about distributed computations titled “Adapting JBotSim to Look-Compute-Move robot systems.”  The JBotSim is a simulation library for distributed algorithms in dynamic network.  The style of programming is mainly even-driven (pulse of a clock, appearance/disappearance of a link, arrival of a message, movement of the node, etc.) Node movements can be controlled by program (e.g. mobile robots or mobility models), or by means of mouse-based interactions during the execution. Beyond its features, the main asset of JBotsim is its simplicity of use.  

#### Responsibilities
First of all, I learned JBotSim and read the document to get familiar with its APIs. Next, I designed a specific robot model that follows a Look-Move-compute Lifecycle and deigned a scheduler for the robots, include synchronous， semi-synchronous, asynchronous. After that, I implemented some new features (such as discrete environment, faulty robots，presence of obstacles and so on) to facilitate the development of mobile robot algorithms.  Finally, I implement a aggregation algorithm in a paper. 

#### Significance
It is useful for theoretical community of distributed computations. The simulation tool can provide evidence of correctness for new distributed algorithms. Lets say, there is a algorithm present in a paper, we can use JBotSim to implement the algorithm and run it with test cases from which we can know the correctness of the algorithm. My supervisor uses this project as a teaching aid in her course.
